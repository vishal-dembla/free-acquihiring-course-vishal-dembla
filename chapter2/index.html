<h1>Chapter 2 — Deal Models: Acquihire-Only, Asset/Share Deals, Team Lift-Outs</h1>

<!-- Meta Description -->
<p><em>Meta Description: Explore the main deal models for acquihiring in India — acquihire-only, asset/share acquisitions, and team lift-outs — with examples, pros/cons, and recruiter insights.</em></p>

<h2>2.1 Why Deal Models Matter</h2>
<p>Acquihiring may sound simple—“buy a startup for its people”—but the <strong>deal structure</strong> decides how smooth or messy the process becomes. Think of it like player transfers in sports. You could buy the <em>whole club</em>, acquire just its <em>training rights</em>, or poach an entire <em>team unit</em> from within. The legal and financial wrapper changes incentives, integration, and risks.</p>
<p>In India, three models dominate: <strong>Acquihire-Only</strong>, <strong>Asset/Share Deals</strong>, and <strong>Team Lift-Outs</strong>. Each has a distinct logic, negotiation dynamic, and compliance burden.</p>

<h2>2.2 Acquihire-Only</h2>
<div class="callout">
<strong>Definition:</strong> An acquihire-only deal transfers the team into the acquirer without buying the startup’s legal entity or IP.
</div>
<p>This is the cleanest form of acquihiring. The acquirer offers jobs, signing bonuses, and retention packages to the target team. Founders may get a one-time payout or join in leadership roles. The original startup entity usually winds down after closing.</p>
<p><strong>Caselet:</strong> In 2020, Razorpay acquihired a small fintech startup in Bengaluru. Rather than acquire the company’s app (which had little traction), Razorpay folded in the engineers to boost its payments stack.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast, light on compliance, minimal liabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Employees may see it as a “soft landing,” not a growth path. Investors often recover little.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.3 Asset or Share Deals</h2>
<p>Sometimes the acquirer prefers to buy either the <strong>assets</strong> (like codebase, IP rights, or office leases) or the <strong>shares</strong> (taking control of the startup entity itself).</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Caselet:</strong> In 2018, Flipkart acquired F1 Info Solutions, not just for its people but also for its service centers. That was structured as a share acquisition to retain ongoing contracts and licenses.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Useful if IP or contracts are valuable.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Slower, heavier diligence, higher legal costs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.4 Team Lift-Outs</h2>
<div class="callout">
<strong>Definition:</strong> A team lift-out is when a company directly hires an entire team (often with founder consent, sometimes quietly), without buying the entity or assets.
</div>
<p>Think of it as acquihiring-lite. The acquirer offers roles to 10–30 people who already work as a pod. The original company may survive, pivot, or downsize.</p>
<p><strong>Caselet:</strong> Several GCCs in Hyderabad have used lift-outs to spin up AI/ML pods by hiring intact startup teams. No formal acquisition—just bulk offers with retention clauses.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> No M&amp;A paperwork, quick, pure talent play.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Can create legal disputes if IP or client contracts are left behind; weaker investor alignment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.5 Recruiter’s Lens</h2>
<p>Each model shifts how recruiters and HR heads operate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquihire-Only:</strong> Focus on <em>retention packages</em> and <em>cultural onboarding</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Asset/Share Deal:</strong> Prepare for <em>compliance mapping</em> (ESOPs, labor dues, contracts).</li>
<li><strong>Lift-Outs:</strong> Watch for <em>non-compete and IP clauses</em> to avoid litigation risks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.6 Risks Across Models</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal Grey Zones:</strong> Lift-outs sometimes trigger disputes over IP ownership.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Morale:</strong> Teams may feel uncertain if deal terms aren’t transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Investor Pushback:</strong> Asset/share deals without proper valuation can leave investors unhappy.</li>
<li><strong>Integration Gaps:</strong> Models with less structure (lift-outs) can miss out on onboarding discipline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.7 Summary</h2>
<p>No deal model is inherently better—it depends on what the acquirer values. <strong>Acquihire-only</strong> is fastest when pure talent is the goal. <strong>Asset/share deals</strong> work if IP, contracts, or licenses add value. <strong>Team lift-outs</strong> are lean but risky if legal and cultural integration is ignored.</p>
<p>For recruiters, the key is understanding the deal wrapper so you can anticipate risks and design retention strategies early.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q1. What’s the fastest acquihire model?</strong><br>Acquihire-only, since it avoids entity-level compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Q2. Do investors benefit in acquihire-only deals?</strong><br>Usually very little—value accrues to employees and sometimes founders.</li>
<li><strong>Q3. Why use a share deal in India?</strong><br>To retain licenses, contracts, or tax structures tied to the legal entity.</li>
<li><strong>Q4. Are team lift-outs legal?</strong><br>Yes, but acquirers must avoid poaching IP or breaching non-compete clauses.</li>
<li><strong>Q5. Which model is most common for GCCs?</strong><br>Team lift-outs, since GCCs often need pods without acquiring entities.</li>
</ul>
